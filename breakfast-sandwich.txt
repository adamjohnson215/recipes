Ingredients:
2-strips hickory-smoked, thick cut bacon
2-pieces whole-wheat bread
2-eggs
2-slices cheddar cheese

Directions:
Over medium-high heat, fry bacon to a dark red-brown color, flipping occasionally to prevent burning.

While bacon is frying, crack the eggs into a mixing bowl and discard the shells. Beat the eggs until they are a homogenous, yellow color. Some heterogeneity may still be present.

Once bacon is finished frying, wrap bacon in paper towels to remove excess grease. Fry eggs in the bacon grease remaining in pan or skillet to prevent eggs from sticking. Toast bread while eggs fry. Flip eggs to cook evenly.
